# IoT-Solution-Bosch

IoT Solution: 1st place </br>
This is the IoT solution winning the 1st place of 2018 BOSCH CHINA IoT HACKATHON.</br>
In order to reuse and recycle the parcels in Bosch supply chain with low cost and high efficiency, we develop a IoT solution, a cloud platform using MVC design pattern deployed in AZURE. This solution is mainly developed in 3 days in the HACHATHON, so there are some places where the code is not standardized and organized well enough.

<ol>
  <li>Through the QR code and RFID, realizing the cascade mode, unitized logistics for turnover box, pallet and truck, reducing the number of hardware to one thousandth. </li>
  <li>Through Arduino, NodeMCU upload environment, geography and other information to Microsoft IoThub, then use stream processing transform the information to Azure sqldatabase for real-time monitoring, decision-making, transportation planning and so on. </li>
  <li>Use machine learning algorithms to implement scheduling, site selection, forecasting, credit rating, etc. </li>
  <li>Recyclable modular turnoverbox design </li>
</ol>
